# Blockly-HTML
Blockly blocks and generators for HTML generation and a demo with live preview

<img src="example.png" width="500" alt="Screenshot" />

## Try the demo

The file `blockly_compressed`, required to run the demo, is not included in this repository, but can be obtained from 
https://github.com/google/blockly/blob/master/blockly_compressed.js

The demo saves the workspace in the local browser storage. Other export/import capabilities are missing, so far.

## Library files

The files `library_html.xml` and `library_html_german.xml` are block libraries that can be used to modify the blocks using the Blockly developer tools: https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html

## TODO
 * Support more HTML tags and attributes
 * Enforce HTML tag-nesting rules via types
 * Allow for block export/import and HTML export in the demo page
 * Many more â€¦
